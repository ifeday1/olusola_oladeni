          BASIC THINGS CHRISTIAN SINGLES SHOULD NOT DO{" "}
        </Text>
        <Text fontStyle="italic">
          But among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or
          any kind of impurity…for these are improper for God’s holy people
          (Eph. 5:3).
        </Text>{" "}
        This dispensation is witnessing all kinds of immoral behaviours. You
        don’t need any telescope before you can see it. The church of God which
        is supposed to be the Vanguard of Morality and purity has lost the
        immunity needed very quickly. Where people should run to has now become
        where people are running away from. However, I still strongly believe
        that there can always be a Virgin Mary and Joseph who will maintain
        purity in every dispensation. May you be the one. There is a serious
        need to call the attention of Christian singles to things they should
        not do. Some of them are: <br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          •Shun Pornography:
        </Text>
        This is the ungodly, immoral treatment of sexual subjects in writing and
        pictures, produced by men of depraved minds, in a way that is intended
        to arouse sexual excitement. As a Christian girl and boy, you should not
        embrace pornography. For instance, when you enter some singles’ rooms
        you see postal, pictures, and sexual subjects. Some singles have
        different kinds of sexual subjects on their handsets. Where are we
        going? <br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Watching Blue Film:
        </Text>
        Blue films are films showing immorality and impurity. For instance, in a
        blue film, you may see a lady and a guy in the act of sexual
        intercourse. Stop watching such. It can only destroy, it cannot edify.
        <br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          •Watching Nudity Ladies and Boys:
        </Text>
        Nude means bare nakedness while unclothed. Do you know that there are a
        lot of nude ladies and boys on the internet? It has been discovered that
        most young boys and ladies who go to the net to browse do go there to
        watch nudity on the internet.<br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Violent Dressing:
        </Text>
        These are the kinds of dressing revealing certain parts of the human
        body e.g. showing breasts, thighs, buttocks, and navels, among others.
        As Christians, you should not be unaware of the fact that most of these
        girls and boys are agents of Satan. Their mission is to cause Christian
        (you) to fall. But ignorantly, some Christian sisters and brothers tend
        to emulate these agents of satan. I encourage you to always dress to
        glorify your God, your maker. You will give an account of how many
        people you lead to hell and their blood will be on your neck. <br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Avoid Incest:
        </Text>
        This is another immorality that is quickly finding its way into our
        society. Incest is a sexual relationship between people who are too
        closely related to marry, as between brother and sister. Incest is a
        grievous sin in the sight of God (Lev. 18:6 -19; Deut. 27:20 -22).
        Symptoms of incest are strange behaviour you notice between you and that
        brother or sister. Such symptom is: 1) when a close related brother or
        sister always touch your body, e.g. breast, buttock, etc. 2) when the
        close related brother or sister is always interested in seeing your
        nakedness; 3) when the close related brother or sister demonstrate
        sexual feeling when together; 4) when they always sleep so close on the
        same bed; whenever you discover these symptoms, either as sister or
        brother please be watchful and be careful. Know that there have been
        cases of a brother who impregnated his sister of the same parents. You
        will not be the next victim. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <Text fontStyle="italic">
          Among factors which can lead to incest are pornography, watching blue
          films, nudity, and violent dressing. So Christian singles should be
          wiser than the devil.
        </Text>{" "}
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Don’t Rape:
        </Text>
        Rape is the act of forcing someone into a sexual relationship against
        his or her wish. Ladies as well as men do rape. It is fun to hear that
        most people, especially ladies who engage in violent dressings do that
        to rape. Likely causes of rape are Abusive words, night partying, pride,
        staying in the dark, loose sleep, uncontrolled visitation and the types
        of relationships you keep.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Avoid Kissing:
        </Text>
        Kiss means to touch with lips as a sign of love or in greeting or
        farewell. It is part of the Hebrew culture and the whites kiss as a sign
        of greetings or farewell. For example, Opah kissed Naomi, and she bid
        her farewell (Ruth 1:4). Apostle Paul, also instructed the Corinthians
        to greet one another with a holy kiss. (2Cor. 13:12). But in Africa,
        particularly in Nigeria, kissing is a sign of love –romantic love.
        Kissing as a sign of greeting or farewell is not part of our culture on
        this side of the world. It is imported into our culture. Some churches
        in the name of holy kiss permit church members to kiss one another. This
        has been causing serious immorality and impurity in some churches. To
        the best of my knowledge, kissing is strongly associated with romantic
        love. Most young ladies and men who engaged in it ended up in sexual
        intercourse. Some resulted in unwanted pregnancies with regret and pain.
        Say no to holy kiss. It is the mother of immorality among singles.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          •Don’t Hug:
        </Text>
        This means “to press tightly in the arms, especially, as a sign of
        love”. “It also means to stay close to something as one follows along
        the edge of it”. People generally hug to bid each other bye-bye or to
        welcome. It is dangerous for the opposite sex to be hugging each other.
        The case of a hug is closely related to a kiss. Hugging is mainly meant
        for the married. These types of hugging according to Adewale (2008) are:
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          • Model ‘A’ Hug:
        </Text>
        This is a single hug with bodies which is meant for a goodbye or welcome
        or public hug.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          • Model ‘P’ Hug:
        </Text>
        This is the type of hugging the third trimester of pregnancy will allow.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          • Model ‘I’ Hug:
        </Text>
        This is putting bodies together, touching and wrapping up against the
        other person. It’s shaped just like I. mode I hug is meant for married
        couples. Today, what do you see? You see both singles and married
        engaging in type ‘I’ hugs. No wonder the case of sexual scandal is
        rampant among us today. Singles I want to beg of you don’t engage in
        what will mar your life. Be wise.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Shun Masturbation:
        </Text>
        This is the production or orgasm by manipulating one’s genitalia by
        oneself. Some singles do masturbate. This they do in response to sexual
        feelings/urges. It is an immoral act (1 Cor. 6:9 -11).
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          • Avoid Cohabitation:
        </Text>
        This is the act of living together outside marriage. That is those who
        are yet to be legally joined together living together as husband and
        wife. Cohabitation has become an accepted norm all over the world.
        Cohabitation is an illegal license to fornication and adultery.
        Cohabitation in most cases does not lead to marriage due to a lack of
        common purpose by those who are involved. A lot of our higher
        institution’s students practice cohabitation. And after they have messed
        up themselves, they finally dump each other. Females are most affected,
        if you are the type who will tell parents that you are going to night
        prayer when in fact you are going to spend the night with your
        boyfriend, you are only deceiving yourself and the curse of God is upon
        you. Do yourself a favour and stop those attitudes today.
        <br></br> <br></br>As you go through courtship, please don’t engage in
        what will wake “the sleeping dog” up. It may bite you beyond your
        expectations. Premarital sex is against the Christian virtues. Keep
        yourself pure. Wait for your time, a time when you would have received a
        license to do everything without fear or frailty. Remember the scripture
        says there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality, or any kind of
        impurity such as pornography, blue film, nude, incest, violent dressing,
        rape, kiss, and hug. Masturbation and cohabitation among you for these
        are improper for God’s holy people.
