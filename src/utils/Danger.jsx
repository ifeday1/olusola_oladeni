          THE DANGER OF MAKING COVENANT
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Introduction
        </Text>
        Covenant making is as old as man. From generation to generation, people
        have covenanted with each other. Though, some are aware of its awful
        effect, they still went ahead to enter into a covenant. Those who enter
        into it ignorantly seems to outnumber those who are actually
        knowledgeable about covenant. This story is a life story of Sister Love
        and Brother Care. They both agree to marry each other. Not quite long in
        their relationship, they felt the need for making a covenant. They
        entered into blood covenant by cutting of their flesh and leaked the
        blood of each other alongside the pronouncement that no one should
        betray and that whoever betray shall die followed by sexual intercourse
        to cement the covenant. After two years, Brother Care impregnated
        another Sister who is now married to him. The problem now is, Sister
        Love was still holding on to the fact that Bro. Care is her husband.
        Anytime, anywhere they see each other, it is sex unlimited. After much
        counselling with Sister Love, she told us that they are into a covenant
        and that nothing can separate them. She is waiting for Bro Care to send
        out the woman he has married with kid. Bro. Care is also claiming that
        Sis. Love is his wife. This was a g problem. Singles, please be wise!
        However, the purpose of this write up is to open the eyes of singles to
        how covenant can affect a person’s life and subject the person into the
        devil’s bondage. In this write-up, therefore, I will examine the
        following: understanding the key concepts, types of covenant, reasons
        why singles make covenant, ways of making covenant, positive effects of
        making covenant, negative effects of making covenant, lessons singles
        should learn and conclusion.

          Understanding the Key Concepts
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          a. Power:
        </Text>
        Synonyms to the word “power” are force, strength and authority. Power,
        therefore, explains the ability to act effectively.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          b. Covenant:
        </Text>
        Synonyms to the word “covenant” are vow, oath and pledge. The word
        covenant describes a formal, binding agreement between two or more
        people or groups. For example a covenant could be between a man and a
        woman, a lady and a guy who pledged to marry each other in future
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          c.Danger:
        </Text>
        The word “danger” describes “the condition of being susceptible to harm
        or injury”. It also explains “a venture undertaken without regard to
        possible loss or injury”.

          Reasons Why Some Singles Make Covenant
        </Text>
        - It is obvious that people, especially singles, covenanted for several
        reasons. Some identified reason include:<br></br>- Some singles make
        covenant in order to remove doubt. <br></br>- Some singles make covenant
        in order to reassure themselves <br></br>- Some singles make covenant in
        order to serve as caution, <br></br>- Some singles make covenant in
        order to place embargo on each other<br></br>- Some singles make
        covenant in order to establish faithfulness.<br></br>- Some singles make
        covenant in order to sustain their bond
        <br></br>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Types of Covenant
        </Text>
        The main two types of covenant I have identified are:
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          a. Direct Covenant:
        </Text>
        This describes the covenant two friends or a man and a woman made
        between themselves.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          b. Indirect Covenant:
        </Text>
        This explained the covenant someone or somebody’s parents made on his or
        her behalf. The person was not directly involved. Such a covenant can
        also be made on behalf of a community of people. Hannah vowed on behalf
        of Samuel (1Samuel 1:10 -11).

          Ways of Making Covenant
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Some of the ways people make or enter into covenant are:

          <Text>
            <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
              Covenant by spoken word:
            </Text>
            Hannah made her vow at Shiloh through a spoken word. We have singles
            who have made covenant through such means. It is efficacious too.
            The story of a girl who charted on social media. The guy told the
            young girl of seventeen said to the guy I love you and the girl
            replied I love you. Then, they started dating. The girl requested,
            “When can I pay you a visit?” the guy said, “You cannot come because
            my father is an herbalist and I don’t trust him”. The guy requested
            that he will pay her a visit. She replied, “My mummy will not
            agree”. But the guy said, “My father has a juju power I will use it,
            just mention the name of one of your brothers that your parents know
            who can come to your house I will just use the face of that brother.
            The girl said, “So your father is as powerful as that I wish to
            know”. That was how he visited her. On his arrival to the house of
            the girl, he met the mother of the girl. The mother asked, “Akin,
            how are you? You don’t go to work today?” He replied, “I have off
            today”. Then, he entered and that was how he started having sex with
            the seventeen years girl. He was the one who deflower her. He had
            sex with her for like five time. She became pregnant for the spirit
            man. Mysteriously, the girl continued to love the spirit guy.

              Covenant by Blood:
            </Text>
            There are two covenants in the New Testament of the Holy bible. The
            new covenant of grace established by Christ, which supersedes the
            old covenant of the law with all its animal sacrifices and
            ritualistic practices in the sense that through the new covenant the
            old is fulfilled and its purpose achieved (Heb. 10:14 – 18). In the
            Old Testament animal’s blood was used as the means for covenant
            while the blood of Jesus Christ was used in the New Testament. The
            traditionalists also use blood as a means for making or sealing up a
            covenant. It is observed that people enter into covenant by cutting
            their flesh, leaking the blood of each other alongside some
            pronouncement to bind them together.

              <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
                Covenant by Sexual Intercourse:
              </Text>
              This also involves blood indirectly. Sexual intercourse usually
              binds a man and a woman together. A woman shared her experience
              with me thus: “Daddy, do you know that each time I travelled to
              where my formal husband lives, he used to have sexual intercourse
              with me”. I asked, “Why did you allow that since you’re married to
              another person? She said “the only reason I think is responsible
              is that he was the one who deflowered me, anytime we see one
              another I am in trouble”. It is about covenant. It is best for
              single males and females to keep themselves. Another sister is a
              single but married because she is under a sexual covenant with a
              married man. She is ready for marriage but she could not find who
              to marry because of the covenant through sexual intercourse. In
              fact, according to her, she said, “people see me as a married
              woman”

                covenant through sexual intercourse. In fact, according to her,
                she said, “people see me as a married woman”

                  Covenant by Deep Kissing:
                </Text>
                This is a form of covenant too. It indirectly involves blood
                too. The covenant can be sealed up with three deep kissing after
                some pronouncements have been made. However, ingredients for
                making covenant includes blood, wood, cola-nut, alligator
                pepper, water, etc. one should be very careful with what he says
                because a word carelessly spoken in the name of love may turn
                against somebody in future.

                Positive Effects of Making Covenant
              </Text>
              a. It binds those who made it together<br></br>
              b. It has the power to bring to pass what was pronounced.<br></br>
              c. It controls the actions of those who made it.<br></br>
              d. When it is kept, those who enter into a covenant may attain
              their goal(s).<br></br>

                Negative Effects of Making Covenant
              </Text>
              Regardless of the positive effects, the evil consequences of
              making covenant make it dangerous and harmful to the life of those
              who have made it. Some effects are: a. It brings calamity upon the
              one who breaks it<br></br>
              b. In case of untimely death of one of the two who have
              covenanted, the one who is alive suffers the embargo being placed
              on him or her, not finding someone to marry.<br></br>
              c. It can lead to mental problem. The one who betrays can run
              mental and the one being betrayed also suffers the pain of being
              disappointed, depending on what was pronounced to be the
              consequence.<br></br>
              d. Most covenants made is irreversible. As such the victim may
              suffer the consequence till death.

                Lessons Singles Should Learn{' '}
              </Text>
              Singles should bear the lessons below in mind 1. It is not good to
              enter into covenant with a sister or brother because of the desire
              to marry each other.<br></br>
              2. Say no to covenant making. If a brother or sister ask you to
              enter into any covenant, please do not yield because yielding is
              killing.<br></br>
              3. Covenant making is not a sign of true love. If you truly love
              each other and it is the will of God for you to marry each other,
              it will surely come to pass.<br></br>
              4. Covenant making is a tool in the hands of the devil. He uses it
              to punish those who embrace it.<br></br>
              5. Always remember that human beings would always be human beings.
              They can disappoint at any time. Only god remains faithful
              forever. If there have been cases of betrayers among those who
              covenanted, yours may not be an exception. So, be wise!<br></br>
              <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
                Conclusion
              </Text>
              Covenant making seems harmless but its consequences can be
              calamitous. Majority of people, particularly singles, who made
              covenant don’t think of its adverse effects. They are concerned
              about the positive benefits without a second thought on the
              negative side effects. As Christians, you don’t need to enter into
              any covenant again. Jesus Christ has made an everlasting covenant
              with us through the shedding of His blood on the cross of Calvary.
              That is potent enough to cover us in all ramifications, be it
              marriage, successful life, ministry, etc. You don’t need to make
              any covenant with any guy or girl, sister or brother; focus on the
              plan and will of God for your life in all ramifications,
              especially in marriage. If not for any reason, the fact that
              covenant making has its negative effects should discourage you
              from entering into it now or in future. Pease be wise!
