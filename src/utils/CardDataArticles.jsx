    price:
      'Introduction Some courtships had broken up as a result of a lack of patience in one or the two who were in the courtship. Some potential couples have missed God’s will for their lives due to a lack of patience. Some are regretting today because impatience has robbed them of the true fortune their ex-partner now possesses. I strongly believe that knowledge of this message will surely help singles in their courtship and future marriages...',

    price:
      'Introduction  In all relationships, especially in marital relationships, the presence of God is very important. The lack of God’s presence is tantamount to a lack of what it takes to make a Christian home. There was a wealthy man in a small village called “Konkobilo”. When he was alive he had companies all over the village and surrounding hamlets. All his companies were thriving, flourishing, and blossoming because the man was around to oversee all business transactions... ',

      ' It is believed that the Apostle Peter wrote the books of First and Second Peter. He gave his testimony in Second Peter chapter one to teach against the heresies of the false teachers and to help other disciples to stand firm in Jesus Christ. As we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, it is very pertinent for us to be aware of certain truths that will keep us in faith and liberate us from wrong teachings and bad news that pervade the world...',

From the primitive to the modern age, every couple who would build a joyful (home) family, not physical house, need these triplet ingredients for building.

      'A song says “worthy, you are worthy, king of kings, Lord of lords, I worship you”, we worship the Lord for who He is and for what He possesses and for what He does. Any life that is devoted of the presence of Jesus is not only worthless; such a life is lifeless. So, the worth of every singles is not unconnected to the presence of Jesus in their life. I would say that no life is as valuable as the life that is rooted in Jesus Christ. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the topic, “Single of Worth” (SOW). If there is anything you should pursue or desire to be; it should be the desire to be a single of worth. 1 Peter 3: 1-7 says...',

      'Covenant making is as old as man. From generation to generation, people have covenanted with each other. Though, some are aware of its awful effect, they still went ahead to enter into a covenant. Those who enter into it ignorantly seems to outnumber those who are actually knowledgeable about covenant. This story is a life story of Sister Love and Brother Care. They both agree to marry each other. Not quite long in their relationship, they felt the need for making a covenant. They entered into blood covenant by cutting of their flesh and leaked the blood of each other alongside the pronouncement...',
