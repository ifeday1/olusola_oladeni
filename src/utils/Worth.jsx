          SINGLE OF WORTH
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Introduction
        </Text>
        A song says “worthy, you are worthy, king of kings, Lord of lords, I
        worship you”, we worship the Lord for who He is and for what He
        possesses and for what He does. Any life that is devoted of the presence
        of Jesus is not only worthless; such a life is lifeless. So, the worth
        of every singles is not unconnected to the presence of Jesus in their
        life. I would say that no life is as valuable as the life that is rooted
        in Jesus Christ. It is, therefore, necessary to consider the topic,
        “Single of Worth” (SOW). If there is anything you should pursue or
        desire to be; it should be the desire to be a single of worth. 1 Peter
        3: 1-7 says, “…Your beauty should not come from outward adornment, such
        as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewellery or fine
        clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, unfading beauty
        of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God’s sight.
        For this is the way the Holy women of the past used to adorn
        themselves…”

          Worth
        </Text>
        Synonyms to the word “worth” are value and deserving. Worth explains
        something equal in value to. The opposite of worth is worthless, which
        means “of no value”. Something or somebody can worth something
        important, good or enjoyable enough to make something or somebody feels
        satisfied.

          Single
        </Text>
        This refers to a young adult who is not married. A lady who is not
        married is also known as a spinster while a man who is not married is
        known as a bachelor. Some singles are engaged –already in courtship
        while some are yet to engage. Whether engaged or not is not the concern
        of this write up. The concern of this write up is about the worth of a
        single. Based on the explanations on words “single and worth”, single of
        worth could describe a young adult, male or female, whose life is of
        great value to God and humanity. A single of worth is not living for
        just anything but for something of worth. Every single of worth deserves
        something or somebody of worth. If you are not a single of worth, you
        are not worthy to have one. Single of worth is like a precious stone.

          Four Vs. That Unveil Attributes of a Single of Worth
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Virginity:
        </Text>
        “Before he had finished – praying, Rebekah came out with her jar on her
        shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel son of Milkah, who was the
        wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. The woman was very beautiful, a virgin;
        no man had ever slept with her. She went down to the spring, filled her
        jar and came up again…” (Genesis 24:15 -16). In the sixth month of
        Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in
        Galilee to a virgin pledged to be married to Joseph, a descendant of
        David. The virgin’s name was Mary. The angel went to her and said,
        greetings, you who are highly favoured! The Lord is with you… (Luke 1:26
        -33). Virginity explains a state of being virgin – without sexual
        experience. To be a virgin is to be fresh, unspoiled, unused. Being
        virgin is a symbol of purity and holiness. Virginity is a value. Those
        who were, and are virgin are valuable. Their worth is their virginity. I
        prefer new brand car to “tokunbo” or fairly used car. If you want
        something new, keep yourself unspoiled. If Mary, Joseph, Isaac, Rebekah,
        John, the Baptist, Elizabeth, Zachariah, among others could be virgin,
        you can be and remain virgin too. We have brand new car, “tokunbo” car,
        Nigerian fairly used car and Nigeria’s over used car. If you are to
        choose, which among the four types of cars will you choose? Did I hear
        you say, brand new car.? Yes, your choice is correct. I ask you, are a
        brand new sister or brother? In Nigeria and perhaps all over the world;
        there are brand new singles, “tokunbo” singles, Nigeria’s fairly used
        singles and Nigeria’s over used singles. Their conditions determine
        their worth. We thank God for His mercy over the lives of brand new
        singles.

          - Virtues:
        </Text>
        The word “virtue” means “any good quality or characteristics. It also
        describes an act of goodness, morality, nobleness and worth of
        characters. A person can possess many virtues. Joseph and Mary possessed
        virtues such faithfulness holiness and righteousness (Matthew 1:18 -25).
        Elizabeth and Zachariah were both righteous, obedient to the law
        blamelessly (Luke 1:5 -7). Joseph, the dreamer feared the Lord,
        maintained sound morality and was diligent at his duties (Genesis 39:1
        -23). Brother Daniel was trustworthy and devoted to God (Daniel 6:1 –9).
        “Inner self, unfading beauty of gentle and quiet spirit, which is of
        great worth in God’s sight” (1Peter 3:4). Virtues such as the fruit of
        the spirit: love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness,
        faithfulness, gentleness and self-control are parts of the qualities
        that distinguish a single of worth (Galatians 5:22 -23). A man or woman
        possess virtues is of noble character. He or she is worth far more than
        rubies (Proverbs 31:10). The person whose life lack good character or
        virtues is worthless.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Visionary:
        </Text>
        The word “visionary” describes an ability to think about or plan the
        future with great imagination and intelligence. Is a person who has the
        ability to think about or plan the future in a way that is intelligent
        or shows imagination? Visionary is related to dreams or strange
        experiences, especially of a religious kind. We can have a visionary
        leader, a visionary leader, a visionary student, etc. Joseph, the
        dreamer, was a visionary youth. He knew the reason for his existence and
        he pursued it consciously. Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus, was a
        visionary single who would not want to marry “fairly used care”. He
        wanted to divorce her secretly in order to prevent her from public
        disgrace. Joseph wanted to do that because he was not unaware of his
        worth and God’s purpose for his life. A visionary single has a plan of
        where he or she is going, in subjection to the will of God. He will do
        away with anything that can prevent him or her from attaining his or her
        goal, when a single derailed like Samson; fulfilling God’s purpose for
        his or her life becomes difficult if not impossible. Will you like to
        marry somebody who is visionless, walking around aimlessly, existing but
        pursuing nothing?
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Victory:
        </Text>
        This refers to an act of being successful in a same, an election, a war,
        a battle, etc. A victor is one who is being victorious over a battle or
        an enemy. The utmost victory is the victory over sin and flesh. Joseph
        was victorious over sexual sin (Genesis 39:11 -23). David was victorious
        over the Goliath and became so famous in Israel (1Samuel 17:32 -58).
        Anyone who is victorious over sin and flesh would win war against Satan.
        This is because God’s power will be available for the person. Generally,
        people celebrate a victor not a vanquish. When one wins a battle; it
        boosts the worth of the person. Moreover, using “Worth” as an acronym;
        it reveals more attributes of a single of worth thus.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Wisdom:
        </Text>
        this refers to the quality of being wise. To be wise is to show good
        senses; the ability to understand what happens and decides on what is
        right. The Lord gives wisdom and from his mouth come knowledge and
        understanding (Proverbs 2:6). The fear of the Lord is the beginning of
        wisdom (Psalm 111:10). Wisdom is supreme; therefore get wisdom (Proverbs
        4:7). God gave Solomon wisdom (1King 4:29). King Solomon was able to
        make right decision, right judgment and hence became greatly rich.
        Single of worth is known for his or her wisdom.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Obedience:
        </Text>
        The word “obedience” describes an act of obeying rules and regulations.
        There are rules and regulation and commands guiding Christian life and
        Christian courtship. Christians especially, singles should follow such
        principles. Obedience to the commands of God boost the worth of
        devotees.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Reliable:
        </Text>
        This refers to something or somebody that is likely to be correct or
        true. Somebody that can be trusted to do something well; that rely on
        and that can be dependable. If you are not reliable, you are not
        dependable. Anyone who is not reliable will have problem in the choice
        of marriage partner and future marriage.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Transparent:
        </Text>
        The word “transparency” means “the quality of something such as a
        situation or an argument that makes it easy to understand. To be
        transparent is to life in such a way that close associates understand
        the person. A transparent single does not live a double standard or
        deceptive life. He opens up and is trustworthy.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontStyle='italics' fontSize='15px'>
          - Honourable:
        </Text>
        To be honourable is to deserve respect and admiration. Allowing somebody

        and keep marriage bed pure are honourable. They deserve respect and

        </Text>

        place value on yourself, God will not value you. God values those who
        value themselves. Don’t forget the Vs. I am not talking about virus.

        victory, and WORTH-Wisdom, obedience, reliable, transparent and
        honourable. Why must you remember the Vs and the “worth”? It is because
        the issue of being a single of worth deals with character quality in a
