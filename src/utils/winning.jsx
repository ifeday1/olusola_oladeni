          THE WINNING SINGLES
        </Text>
        “Therefore, I will take my corn when it ripens, and my new wine when it
        is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her
        naked body. So, now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her
        lover; no one will take her out of my hands” (Hosea 2:9-10).

          Introduction
        </Text>
        No battle no title. No one can be a winner without being involved in a
        race or competition. The topic, The Winning Singles, suggests that some
        singles are in an unending competition or race but that they are winning
        each moment of the race, even as the race continues. Are you really a
        winning single? You will know whether you are a winning single or not by
        the time you conclude reading this piece. The aim of this teaching is to
        create in all singles the winning mind-sets and mentality. Let us
        understand the key two concepts, the theological meaning of the Hosea
        2:9-10, the nature of singles battle, the winning strategies,

          Singles:
        </Text>
        The word “singles” describes a teenager, an adolescent, youths (male and
        female) who is yet to get married. Some of these singles are engaged
        while some are unengaged.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Winning:
        </Text>
        The word “winning” is from the verb win. To win is to be a winner in a
        contest or competition. To be victorious or to attain success or reach a
        desired goal. The word “winning” therefore means succeeding with great
        difficulty.

          Winning singles:
        </Text>
        Winning singles explains teenagers, adolescents and youths (males and
        females) who are yet to get married; winning the battle between the
        Spirit and flesh, reaching their desired goals. This desired goal may be
        spiritual, academics, physical, social, etc.

          Understanding Hosea 2:9-10.
        </Text>
        The scripture says, “Therefore, I will take my corn when it ripens, and
        my new wine when it is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen,
        intended to cover her naked body. So now I will expose her lewdness
        before the eyes of her lover; no one will take her out of my hands”
        (Hosea 2:9-10). The picture painted her is about the relationship
        between Israel and God. God is pictured as the husband while Israel as
        the wife. Israel did not acknowledge God of fertility, who blesses them
        with grain, wine and oil. The Israelites and Canaanites attributed
        grain, wine and oil to Baal- the Canaanites god who was believed to
        control the weather and the fertility of crops, animals and man (Judges
        2:13). Owing to the unfaithfulness of the Israelites, God decided to
        punish them by withholding the fruits of the field and flock, the Lord
        made known as the true source of those blessing; and by exposing the
        filthiness of Israel being an unfaithful wife to God, her husband (Hosea
        2:9-10).

          The Nature of the Battle Singles do Face
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          The battle in relation to Idolatry:
        </Text>
        Idolatry means the worship of other god in place of the living God. The
        Israelites could not stand firm; they worshipped the Canaanites Baal.
        They were deceived into the belief that Canaanites Baal was the God of
        fertility. Hence they shifted their attentions from God to Baal for
        grain, wine and oil. Whatever takes the place of God is a form of Idol.
        The form of Idolatry today manifests as people shift their attentions
        from God to money, materialism and other worldly things. No time for the
        living God but people could find time for worldly things. Some singles,
        who are mostly youths, are vulnerable in this matter because they are at
        the phase of life where they are struggling to make wealth.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          The battle in relation to Unfaithfulness:
        </Text>
        Looking at it from husband and wife relationship, the Israelites became
        unfaithful to God because they entered into a strange relationship with
        another husband (Baal). Two dimensions of unfaithfulness here: first,
        unfaithfulness in sharing the faithfulness meant for the living God with
        another thing. Second, unfaithfulness to one’s courtship partner. Why
        should a brother who is pledged to be married to a sister impregnates
        another sister? Why should a sister who is pledged to a brother become
        pregnant for another brother? The issue of unfaithfulness is a serious
        battle among singles, even Christian singles.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          The battle in relation to Immorality:
        </Text>
        The case of immorality is a big issue. Some of our singles victorious
        over immorality while some are extremely battling with immorality. Some
        singles involve in pornography: This is the ungodly, immoral treatment
        of sexual subjects in writing and pictures, produced by men of depraved
        minds, in a way that is intended to arouse sexual excitement. As
        Christian girl and boy, you should not embrace pornography. For
        instance, you enter into some singles’ room you see postal, pictures,
        and showing sexual subjects. Some singles have different kind of sexual
        subjects on their handsets. Where are we going? Watching of Blue Film:
        Blue films are films showing immorality and impurity. For instance in a
        blue film you may see a lady and a guy in the act of sexual intercourse.
        Stop watching such. It can only destroy, it cannot edify. Watching
        Nudity Ladies and Boys: Nude mean bare nakedness on unclothed. Do you
        know that there are lot of nude ladies and boys on the internet? It has
        been discovered that most young boys and ladies who go to the net to
        browse do go there to watch nudity on the internet. All these activities
        can trigger sexual urge and can motivate the victims to engage in sexual
        sins such as masturbation, rape, etc.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          The battle in relation to Hedonism:
        </Text>
        The word “hedonism” is a philosophical parlance. Hedonism is a principle
        of pleasure seeking attitude. Generally, human beings like pleasure.
        This attitude is rampant among youth. A good number of youths are found
        in this condition. It is noted that pleasure seeking attitude is
        negatively their attitudes to their academic pursuit, career
        development, creativity and innovation among others. Due to hedonism,
        some are not up and doing in what they do and so they perform less than
        expected. They are tails instead of being heads.

          Singles and Winning Strategies
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Put God first:
        </Text>
        “But seek first his kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these
        things will be given to you as well” (Mathew 6:33). “But remember the
        Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth,
        and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is
        today” (Deuteronomy 8:18). 6:17 Command those who are rich in this
        present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth, which
        is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us
        with everything for our enjoyment. 6:18 Command them to do good, to be
        rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share. 6:19 In
        this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation
        for the coming age, so that they may take hold of the life that is truly
        life. 6:20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to your care. Turn
        away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely
        called knowledge, 6:21 which some have professed and in so doing have
        wandered from the faith. Grace be with you (1 Timothy 6: 17-21). Don’t
        joke with God and anything that concerns God. Allow God to take his
        rightful place in your life. The living God is the source of blessings.
        Serve the Lord with all your strength, soul, spirit and body. Worship
        him with everything he has blessed you with.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Don’t love money at the expense of your love for Christ.
        </Text>
        Flee the Love of Money: “6:5 and constant friction between men of
        corrupt mind, who have been robbed of the truth and who think that
        godliness is a means to financial gain. 6:6 But godliness with
        contentment is great gain. 6:7 For we brought nothing into the world,
        and we can take nothing out of it. 6:8 But if we have food and clothing,
        we will be content with that. 6:9 People who want to get rich fall into
        temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that
        plunge men into ruin and destruction. 6:10 For the love of money is a
        root of all kinds of evil. Some people, eager for money, have wandered
        from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs. 6:11 But you,
        man of God, flee from all this, and pursue righteousness, godliness,
        faith, love, endurance and gentleness. 6:12 Fight the good fight of the
        faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you
        made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses. 6:13 In the
        sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, who
        while testifying before Pontius Pilate made the good confession, I
        charge you 6:14 to keep this command without spot or blame until the
        appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, 6:15 which God will bring about in
        his own time--God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and
        Lord of lords, 6:16 who alone is immortal and who lives in
        unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can see. To him be honor
        and might forever. Amen” (1 Timothy 6: 5-15).
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Flee from Sexual Immorality:
        </Text>
        6:16 Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one
        with her in body? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh." 6:17
        But he who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit. 6:18
        Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a man commits are outside
        his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body. 6:19 Do
        you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in
        you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; 6:20 you
        were bought at a price. Therefore honor God with your body. Maintain
        purity (1 Corinthians 6: 16-20). But among you there must not be even a
        hint of sexual immorality, or any kind of impurity…for these are
        improper for God’s holy people (Ephesians 5:3). Live above pornography,
        watching of blue film, nude and nudity and all associated form of
        impurity.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Top Your Mates:
        </Text>
        You have to “Top” your mates. What does it mean therefore to “top” your
        mates? To top your mates means to outshine your mates in everything you
        do academically, professionally, spiritually, etc. shun all forms of
        pleasures now in order to secure lasting pleasure tomorrow. Here, “Top”
        is used as an acronym. So, top your equals’ means that you have to:
        <br></br>1. Tackle the problem your equal cannot tackle. There was a
        problem in the land of Egypt some years ago. The problem was
        interpretation of the dream the king had. The magician tried but they
        could not interpret it. Joseph interpreted the dreams and he became the
        governor of Egypt. He topped his equal and he was placed at the top.
        What of Daniel? Daniel interpreted the dreams and the hand writing on
        the wall and he was appointed into the administrative position in
        Babylon.
        <br></br>2. Operate uniquely in all you do. Josiah operated differently
        to the way his forefathers (2kings 23:1-30). Think on the operations of
        Joseph and Jesus. A lot of people cannot make it in their lives, in
        leadership, business and ministry because they maintain a kind of status
        quo in the way they operate. They cannot do something unique to the
        former.
        <br></br>3. Pay attention to your vision rather than paying attention to
        obstacles. One thing among others than hinders vision to come to pass is
        paying attention to obstacles. If you really want to set to the top, if
        you really want to change the history of your dispensation positively,
        you need not to pay attention to Sabbalant and Tobia, that is, obstacles
        to build your business, obstacles to realize your vision, obstacles to
        pass that examination, etc. Nehemiah disregarded all the plans of
        Sabbalant and Tobia and he was able to build the wall of Jerusalem. This
        remains a record breaking project in history.

          Conclusion
        </Text>
        Are you a willing single or a losing single? Let me remind you that you
        are not a winners if God is not in His rightful place in your life; if
        you are overpowered by immorality; if you are not faithful with your
        future partner; if you are not a goal setter and goal getter; if you
        quit in the face of challenge; if you are not outstanding in all you do.
        Thomas Jefferson said, “Nothing can stop the man with the right mental
        attitude from achieving his goal; nothing can help the man with wrong
        mental attitude”. I therefore encourage all singles listening to me to
        be winners like Joseph who won over sexual temptation; David who won the
        battle against Goliath for the Israelites; Daniel who decided to worship
        God, the only living Lord against the wish of his enemies which was to
        bowl for an image of gold; In fact, winning will bail you out of the
        wrath of God as declared in Hosea 2:9-10). The scripture says,
        “Therefore, I will take my corn when it ripens, and my new wine when it
        is ready. I will take back my wool and my linen, intended to cover her
        naked body. So now I will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her
        lover; no one will take her out of my hands” (Hosea 2:9-10). May you
        never be blotted out of the book of life.
