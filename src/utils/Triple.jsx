          THE TRIPLE INGREDIENTS FOR BUILDING
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Introduction
        </Text>
        “Anyone who marries a wise person grows wise but he who marries a fool
        suffers harm”. The wise couple learns from the mistakes of others but
        the fool couple learn from their own mistakes. From the primitive to the
        modern age, every couple who would build a joyful (home) family, not
        physical house, need these triplet ingredients for building. The Lord
        gives wisdom and from His mouth comes knowledge and understanding
        (Proverbs 2:6). “By wisdom a house is built, and through understanding
        it is established; through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and
        beautiful treasures. A wise man has great power, and a man of knowledge
        increases strength ;…( Proverbs 24:3 -5). The wise woman builds her
        house but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down” (Proverbs
        14:1). Based on the above passages quoted, the triple ingredients for
        building a Christian home are:
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Knowledge
        </Text>
        Every marriage partner needs knowledge. Knowledge describes the
        information and skills one acquires through training, education or
        experience or by reading books, Christian literatures etc. It is
        generally believe that knowledge is power. I would say that Knowledge is
        power when it is properly applied. Specifically, we do acquire or get
        information by reading the Bible (marriage manual) and listening to
        people who teach God’s word, particularly on marriage. Through God’s
        word, we learn how to forgive (Matthew 6:6 -14), how to love and respect
        (Eph. 5:21 -33), how to be contented (1Timothy 6:6), just to mention but
        a few. The word of God really reveals principles for building a
        Christian home. The scripture says, “Through knowledge its rooms are
        filled with rare and beautiful treasures” Treasures explain wealth in
        the form of gold, silver, jewels, among others. Treasures are good
        things needed in the home. Treasures are things we purchase one-by-one,
        which later become numerous. An example is the Shunamite woman (a well
        to do woman) and her husband, who decided and made a room for Elisha.
        They put in the room a bed and a table, a chair and a lamb for the man
        of God (2Kings 4:8 -17). No doubt that their room too must have been
        filled with such treasures. They must have acquired knowledge on things
        that could be needed in such a room. According to knowledge, it is
        therefore expedient for husband and wife to trust themselves, handle
        their finances, pursue single goal, and be responsible and accountable
        to each other. These and many more will afford them the opportunity to
        fill their home and life with treasures.

          Understanding
        </Text>
        I asked a young lady who was trusting God for who to marry years ago,
        afater a man proposed to her, to tell me three reasons why she was
        convinced to marry the man. She said, “God told me that I need love,
        understanding and have faith in order to marry the man”. Understanding
        is a key concept for making a successful marriage. What is
        understanding? It describes the ability to understand or have a
        knowledge why people behave in a particular way and the willingness to
        forgive them when they do something wrong. The scripture says “through
        understanding a house is established”. The complex nature of human
        beings makes it somehow difficult for them to understand themselves. No
        matter how complex, husband and wife have the sole obligation to study
        one another and understand each other. The first one and half years of
        our marriage were so tasking because we were learning how to understand
        each other. Though there are still a lot to understand about each other
        but twenty five (25) years of marital life has taught us great lessons
        and has given us broad understanding about one another. I assumed many
        things about my wife while she equally did similarly. A times she
        complained about my attitude in some areas which I equally did about her
        but in all of those we were both aware that what is needed is
        understanding. Of recent, a newly wedded couple reported their case to
        me. The simple truth I discovered in their case is lack of understanding
        and patience which I made them to know. I hope they will soon overcome
        it. Regardless of how old one is in marriage understanding one’s partner
        is very paramount. Husband and wife should use understanding to build by
        realizing that: - Both of them are not the same. - Gender factor has key
        role to play in one’s disposition to issues. - Both of them have to
        graciously accept temperamental devices - Both should learn to comprise
        - Both should be ready to put the other person first - Both should learn
        to adjust to each other - Both should pay attention to the mood and
        feelings of each other - Both should always remember that they were not
        from the same background. - Both should be willing explore the most
        irritating attitude positively. Mrs. Abigael Nabal really understood her
        husband. Through that understanding she prevented her home/family from
        being destroyed by King David. When Abigael saw David, she quickly got
        off her donkey and bowed down before David with her face to the ground
        and said don’t pay attention to that wicked man Nabal…(1Samuel 25:23
        -25). The fact is, it is not possible to understand your spouse
        completely, use the little understanding you have about your spouse to
        establish your home.

          Wisdom
        </Text>
        The general saying is that wisdom is the application of knowledge.
        Wisdom is when knowledge is correctly applied. A lot of things are said
        about wisdom in the Holy Bible. God is willing to give wisdom to
        everyone who desires it. However, the ultimate condition for getting
        wisdom from God is to fear Him. The scripture says, “The fear of the
        Lord is the beginning of Wisdom; all who follow his precepts have good
        understanding. To him belongs eternal praise (Psalm 111:10). Any man or
        woman who finds wisdom is blessed (Prov. 3:13), with the blessing of a
        well-built family. A wise man and woman build their house on the rock
        but the fool build his/her house on the sand (Matthew 24:24 -27). What
        is wisdom? It is commonly defined as the right application of knowledge.
        Wisdom describes the ability to make sensible decisions and give good
        advice because of the experience and knowledge that one possesses.
        Wisdom is highly needed by married couples, even singles who are
        trusting God for their future homes need wisdom because wisdom will help
        them in: Making the right decision at the right time. Wisdom was
        displayed by Joseph and Mary when they ran away from Bethlehem to Egypt
        for the safety of the newly born king (Matthew 2:13 -18). It was a right
        decision at the right time. Building solid and lasting relationship,
        hence, solid home. Bringing up children who are filled with wisdom.
        Solomon is product of such venture. Balancing every action and reaction.
        Communicating their ideas, feelings and concern to each other. The
        virtuous woman in Proverbs 31:26 spoke with wisdom. Securing their
        future and that of their children. I would say that there can be earthly
        and heavenly wisdom. The two wisdoms, but heavenly kingdom should be
        desired.

          Attributes of heavenly Wisdom
        </Text>
        According to James 3:17, attributes of the wisdom that comes from above
        (God) are: 1. It is pure 2. It is peace-making 3. It is considerate 4.
        It is submissive 5. It is full of mercy and good deeds 6. It is
        impartial and sincere
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Attributes of Earthly Wisdom
        </Text>
        As identified by the book of James 3: 13-16, attributes of earthly
        wisdom include the following: It harbours bitter envy  It harbours
        selfish ambition It is boastful It denies the truth
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Conclusion
        </Text>
        Somebody said “knowledge is acquiring fact, understanding is analysing
        fact while wisdom uses facts”. As couples acquire fact, analyse fact and
        use fact, they should always remember that in Christ are hidden all the
        treasures of wisdom and knowledge. Colossians 2:3 says, “My goal is that
        they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so they may have
        full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the
        mystery of God namely, Christ, in whom are hidden all the treasures of
        wisdom and knowledge”. Let Jesus be the source of your wisdom as against
        the earthly wisdom. This reminds me of something I read on a WhatsApp
        platform recently about two donkeys who engaged on a conversation a day
        after the triumphant entry of the Lord. It goes thus: First donkey said
        “people don’t recognize me again like they did yesterday when Jesus rode
        on me and walked on their cloaks in great honour. Second donkey
        responded and said “Do you think you were the one people honoured? If
        you were honoured in any way at all, it was because of Jesus Christ on
        you. Without Jesus you are nothing”. The lesson is, without Jesus Christ
        in a person’s life; the life of such a person cannot attract any
        recognition or honour. If the life of a husband or a wife lacks Jesus
        Christ, in whom the treasures of knowledge, understanding and wisdom are
        hidden, the triple ingredients will be lacking. Definitely, it will be
        difficult for such a spouse to build or co-build and nurture joyful
        family for God.
