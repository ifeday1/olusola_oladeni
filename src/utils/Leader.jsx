          FIVE ‘Ps’ THAT CAN MAKE OR MAR A LEADER
        </Text>
        “Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
        and made him king in the place of his father Amziah. He was the one who
        rebuilt Elath and restored to Judahafter Amaziah rested with his
        ancestors. Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother’s name was
        Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem. He did what was right in the eyes of
        the Lord, Just as his father Amaziah had done. He sought God during the
        days of Zachariah who instructed him in the fear of the Lord. As long as
        he sought the Lord, God gave him success. He went to war against the
        Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabnet and Ashdod. He then
        rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. God
        helped him against the Philistines and against Arabs who lived in Gur
        Baal and against the Meunites. The Ammonites brought tributes to Uzziah,
        and his fame spread as far as the boarder of Egypt, because he had
        become very powerful. Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner
        Gate, at the Valley Gate and at the angle of the wall, and fortified
        them. He also built towers in the wilderness and dug many cisterns,
        because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain. He had
        people working his fields and vineyards in the hill and fertile lands,
        for he loved the soil. Uzziah had a well-trained army, ready to go out
        by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by Jeiel the
        secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the direction of Hananiah, one
        of the royal officials. The total number of family leaders over the
        fighting men was 2, 600. Under their command was an army of 307,500 men
        trained for war, a powerful force to support the kings against his
        enemies. Uzziah provided shields, spears, helmetcoat of armour, bows,
        and slingstones for the entire army. In Jerusalem he made devices
        invented for use on the towers and on the corner defences so that
        soldiers could shoot arrows and hurls stones from the walls. His fame
        spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful.
        “But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was
        unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to
        burn incense on the altar of incense. Azariah the priest with eighty
        other outraged priests of the Lord followed him in; they confronted him
        and said, ‘It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord.
        That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been
        consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been
        unfaithful; and you will not be honoured by the Lord God.’ Uzziah, who
        had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he
        was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in
        the Lord’s temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead. When Azariah the
        chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he
        had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself
        was eager to leave, because the Lord had afflicted him. King Uzziah had
        leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house – leprous,
        and excluded from the temple of the Lord. Jotham his son had charge of
        the palace and governed the place of the land” (2 Chronicles 26:16-21).

          Introduction
        </Text>
        A leader is an imperfect human being going through a process of becoming
        as he leads. The great error in leadership is not the error committed by
        a leader but failure to learn from the error. No leader is immune
        against pitfalls. It takes a wise leader to fall into a pit and never to
        fall into the same there after. If you see a leader falling into the
        same pit now and then, he may soon be swallowed by the pit and never to
        come out again. Hence, leadership opportunity is gone. The best way to
        keep the leadership position you occupy is to continually learn from
        your mistakes never to repeat same so soon, depending on the mistakes
        committed. It depends on the nature of mistakes because; the only leader
        who will never commit mistakes is a leader who will never do new things.
        If a leader is doing new things mistakes are inevitable. Please be
        carried home and not to be carried away, I am talking about five “Ps”
        that can make or mar a leader. The five “Ps” were revealed to me by the
        great teacher, the Holy Spirit as I meditated on 2 Chronicles 26: 16-21.
        They are discussed accordingly thus:

          PEOPLE

        “Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old,
        and made him king in the place of his father Amziah. He was the one who
        rebuilt Elath and restored to Judah after Amaziah rested with his
        ancestors. Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became and he reigned in
        Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was
        from Jerusalem. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, Just as
        his father Amaziah had done. He sought God during the days of Zachariah
        who instructed him in the fear of the Lord. As long as he sought the
        Lord, God gave him success” (2 Chronicles 26:1-5). People explains “any
        group of human beings, men or women or children collectively”. No leader
        can succeed without people. I would say that leadership failure may also
        occur as a result of the kind of people involved. There are good and bad
        people. People can be good and can be bad. Ojemola said that whenever
        there are people there will be problem there”. Wherever there are bad
        people, there will be problem. It should be submitted that the one who
        is using the people determines whether they are good or bad. If it is
        God that is in control of people’s heart, their attitudes would be good
        but if Satan is in control of people’s hearts, they would behave badly.
        The same people who lift up can pull down. People who praise today can
        crucify tomorrow. After the death of Amaziah, the people of Judah took
        Uzziah at age sixteen year old and made him king in place of his father.
        The people must have seen certain qualities in the life of Uzziah. God’s
        indirect way of choosing is using his people to choose from among his
        people those who will lead his people. Whether by election, selection or
        by appointment; God uses people. Particularly in the Church, people
        elect deacons and deaconess. God also uses Nominating Committee to
        select those who will anchor certain offices. God has made available
        people around us to make us. May our lives never be marred by people and
        may our lives be made by people in Jesus name. Nevertheless, my little
        experiences in pastoral leadership has uncovered that people are great
        instruments for leadership achievements if they are properly tutored and
        disciple.

          POSITION
        </Text>
        “Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in
        Jerusalem for fifty-two years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was
        from Jerusalem. He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, Just as
        his father Amaziah had done. He sought God during the days of Zachariah
        who instructed him in the fear of the Lord. As long as he sought the
        Lord, God gave him success. He went to war against the Philistines and
        broke down the walls of Gath, Jabnet and Ashdod. He then rebuilt towns
        near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. God helped him against
        the Philistines and against Arabs who lived in Gur Baal and against the
        Meunites. The Ammonites brought tributes to Uzziah, and his fame spread
        as far as the boarder of Egypt, because he had become very powerful (2
        Chronicles 26:3-8). Position explains “a condition or position in which
        you find yourself”. It also describes “the post or function properly or
        customarily occupied or served by another”. Position explains a job in
        an organization”. Generally speaking, the enthronement of Uzziah exposes
        four things:
        <br></br>1. The age of Uzziah when he became King: “Uzziah was sixteen
        years old when he became and he reigned in Jerusalem for fifty-two
        years. His mother’s name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem”.
        <br></br>2. The name of his mother and she comes from: “His mother’s
        name was Jekoliah; she was from Jerusalem”
        <br></br>3. The name of the prophet who instructed him: He sought God
        during the days of Zachariah who instructed him in the fear of the Lord.
        As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success” (2 Chronicles
        26:1-5).
        <br></br>4. The good works of his father. “He did what was right in the
        eyes of the Lord, Just as his father Amaziah had done”. People will not
        know certain things about you until you get to a position. An example is
        the reading of a person’s biography. Generally speaking, people like
        position, and that is why when people get to positions; they will not
        want to leave the positions. They want to die on the positions. The
        position one occupies determines the roles and responsibilities the
        occupier will perform. The roles a king will perform is same with the
        roles a governor will perform. The roles a pastor will perform is not
        same with the roles a deacon will perform. I would say that position is
        not as important as the responsibilities one would have to perform in
        that position. Uzziah maximized his position to win war against the
        Philistines, broke down the walls of Gath, Jabnet and Ashdod; and then
        rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines. God
        helped him against the Philistines and against Arabs who lived in Gur
        Baal and against the Meunites. Uzziah achieved greatly because he sought
        God during the days of Zachariah who instructed him in the fear of the
        Lord. As long as he sought the Lord, God gave him success. The success
        that he recorded brought him honour and fame. A position that is
        judiciously used can be a stepping stone to another better position. God
        expects everyone he puts in a position to accomplish for his purpose.
        Are you carrying out your responsibilities in the position you occupy or
        you are just occupying it for it sake. A barren leader has nothing to
        show for the position they occupy. They are not fruitful. Do you know
        that your achievement is tied to the kind of advisers that surround you
        and the kind of people you go to for counsel; how you process and allow
        God to lead you to do what will glorify him and not what will glorify
        man. Quick to remember is the case of King Rehoboam and the advisers of
        the elders and the young men. The elders, who served his father, advised
        him to give favourable answer to his people but Rehoboam rejected it. He
        accepted the counsel of the young men who grew up with him and made
        their yoke heavier than the yoke Solomon his father place on them (1
        King 12: 1-15). The consequences of Rehoboam’s refusal to listen to the
        Israelites led to division, separation, rebellion and commotion and loss
        of life. No achievements recorded (1 Kings 12:16-24). When God is
        brushed aside people would take their sides.

          POWER
        </Text>
        “God helped him against the Philistines and against Arabs who lived in
        Gur Baal and against the Meunites. The Ammonites brought tributes to
        Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the boarder of Egypt, because he
        had become very powerful” (2 Chronicles 26:7-9). “In Jerusalem he made
        devices invented for use on the towers and on the corner defenses so
        that soldiers could shoot arrows and hurls stones from the walls. His
        fame spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became
        powerful” (2 Chronicles 26: 15). As good as position is, position can
        intoxicate. The word “powerful” is from the word “power”. Powerful
        explains “having great power or force or potency or effect” or “strong
        enough to knock down or overwhelm”. Power is “the ability to act
        effectively”. Power is also referred to as authority, which means “the
        right to act”. John Dalberg-Acton said, “Power tend to corrupt, and
        absolute power corrupt absolutely”. So, Uzziah became powerful.
        Contextually, it means that he taught that he could do whatever he
        likes. He felt he did not need people’s help anymore. Power is not bad
        in its own. God gives us power to act rightly and the ability to be
        effective in whatever we do. A song says, “Satan shame on to you all
        power belong to Jesus, Satan shame on to you all power belong to our
        God”. Moreover, on the day of Pentecost, the disciples received power
        after the Holy Spirit came on them. Jesus said “But you will receive
        power when the Holy Spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in
        Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaritan, and to the ends of the earth
        Acts 1:8. This promise come to pass in Acts 2:1 so anyone who belongs to
        the camp of God is a person of power. This power is given for a purpose
        and to achieve a purpose in our lives (Acts 2:1-4). God is an epitome of
        power. He has all power. He demonstrated his power at read sea, at
        Jordan River, at Jericho wall. He demonstrated over the Egyptians, the
        Midianites, etc. God’s power is given to God’s people in order to help
        them in troubled times. Paul was grated anointed yet greatly buffeted
        Acts 19:20, 11-12; 2 Corinthians 1:8) whatever you are passing through
        don’t trust in yourself, trust in God, have faith in God, have testimony
        to share, change your orientation, pray (Psalms 55:16-18), be best
        assured of God’s power for you 72:12, trust God’s power which is in you,
        dive into God’s word, lay hold of your special promise Matt. 7:9-1 Eph.
        3:20. 1. God’s power is given to God’s people for the manifestation of
        spiritual gifts 1 Cor. 12:6-11. God who gives Jesus, the only son can
        give you good gift. God’s gift to humanity (Jesus) is not limited to any
        ethnic group or tribe. Spiritual gifts are God’s power in the lives of
        His man. God’s gifts are given by God as He phases. All gifts are traced
        to the Holy Spirit. 2. God’s power is given to God’s people to obey and
        doing the will of God (Matt. 28:18-20). He are given the power and
        authority to obey and doing the work of missions and evangelism. There
        is power in a shared vision for God. It God vision we share in
        precreation Molly Turnover said “They are His. Its turn part of our
        obedience to bring to them here, we should also obey God in training,
        discipline our children. There the power in reaching out for God; there
        is power in working together with others. Illustrate Lydia’s pallet
        here, experience of missionaries It is high time to make God’s given
        power to work in our lives church and society. The power of God is not
        given for its sake but it is given to do His work. We should all arise,
        wake up and shake up the world through the work of missions and
        evangelism.

          POSSESSION
        </Text>
        “…He then rebuilt towns near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.
        God helped him against the Philistines and against Arabs who lived in
        Gur Baal and against the Meunites. The Ammonites brought tributes to
        Uzziah, and his fame spread as far as the boarder of Egypt, because he
        had become very powerful. Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner

        soldiers could shoot arrows and hurls stones from the walls. His fame
        spread far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became
        powerful…” (2 Chronicles 26: 6-15). Out of the great wealth that Uzziah
        made, he built towers in Jerusalem, he built towers in the wilderness
        and dug many cisterns for his large livestock. He was an employer of
        labour because people were working for him in his field. Uzziah was
        blessed with Thousands of fighting men and he provided fighting weapons
        for his warriors. So, he became famous. Perhaps, his possessions led to
        his pride. The word “possession” explains the act of having and
        controlling property. Possession explains what one owned. Though, some
        Christians have been wealthy before they are elected or appointed to be
        church workers or church leaders, but position is usually a platform to
        acquire wealth or possession. Certain position can accelerate wealth
        acquisition while others may not. It is not a sin to possess possession;
        it becomes a sin when one allows possession to possess him or her. Or to
        replace the place of God. Church workers who are like Simon the sorcerer
        can use their money to buy the conscience of their leaders because to
        them everything is about money (Acts 8: 9-25). It is not impossible that
        some were made church workers because of their money. Two things would
        likely happen in a situation where a rich person is made a church
        worker. One, a wealthy man who is made a church worker may be proud,
        controlling and self-centered. The rich fool is a good example here
        (Luke 12: 16-21). Two, a wealthy man who was made a church worker may be
        humble and submit himself or herself to the leadership of the church
        leader. A good example is wealthy Dorcas who used her wealth to help the
        poor (Acts 9:32-43).

          PRIDE
        </Text>
        “But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was
        unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to
        burn incense on the altar of incense. Azariah the priest with eighty
        other outraged priests of the Lord followed him in; they confronted him
        and said, ‘It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord.
        That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been
        consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary, for you have been
        unfaithful; and you will not be honoured by the Lord God.’ Uzziah, who
        had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became angry. While he
        was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in
        the Lord’s temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead. When Azariah the
        chief priest and all the other priests looked at him, they saw that he
        had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out. Indeed, he himself
        was eager to leave, because the Lord had afflicted him. King Uzziah had
        leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house – leprous,
        and excluded from the temple of the Lord. Jotham his son had charge of
        the palace and governed the place of the land” (2 Chronicles 26:16-21).
        “Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall”
        (Proverbs 16:18). Pride has the enablement to mar or make a leader.
        “Great leaders never see themselves better than the people they are
        trying to lead”. It seems to more dreadful if not handled sensibly.
        Pride can be used in two opposite ways. It can be used both negatively
        and positively to mean two different things.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Positive Usage –
        </Text>
        a person can take pride in another person, maybe because of certain
        attributes the person possesses or the character he displays. Pride, in
        this context, simply means “delight in” something or somebody. For
        instance, the apostle Paul expressed his delight for the great concern
        demonstrated by the Corinthians. He said, “I have great confidence in
        you; I take great pride in you, I am greatly encouraged; in our troubles
        my joy knows no bounds” (2 Corinthians 7:4). This type of “pride” is
        good.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Negative Usage –
        </Text>
        the negative type of pride means boast, self-importance, self-esteem, to
        mention but few. God hates this kind of pride (Proverbs 8:13). He brings
        down the pride of the proud (Isaiah 25:11). What the Scripture says in
        Proverbs 16:18 that “pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit
        before a fall” manifested in the life of the king. The Scripture says:
        “But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his downfall. He was
        unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple of the Lord to
        burn incense on the altar of incense. Azariah the priest with eighty
        other outraged priests of the Lord followed him in; they confronted him
        and said, ‘It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord.
        That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who have been
        consecrated to burn incense. The above passage sheds some light on King
        Uzziah’s life before pride set in. He had a good relationship with God
        (vs. 1-5), by which God assisted him to make certain reforms. He had a
        well-trained army and God helped him against his enemies (vs. 6, 11-15).
        He was a great farmer (vs. 9-10). He was so famous that his fame spread
        far and wide, for he was greatly helped until he became powerful. The
        key message of God to you is that you must be watchful and careful when
        things are going well with you. When Uzziah became powerful, he ascribed
        his power to himself. Pride made him to neglect the Lord. As clearly
        indicated in verses sixteen to twenty-one above, the following are the
        consequences of pride in Uzziah’s life and ministry:

          Pride led to his downfall:
        </Text>
        “pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall” Proverbs
        16: 18). “But after Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his
        downfall. He was unfaithful to the Lord his God, and entered the temple
        of the Lord to burn incense on the altar of incense. Azariah the priest
        with eighty other outraged priests of the Lord followed him in; they
        confronted him and said, ‘It is not right for you, Uzziah, to burn
        incense to the Lord. That is for the priests, the descendants of Aaron,
        who have been consecrated to burn incense (2 Chronicles 26: 16).

          Pride led him to take up the priest’s responsibilities he ought not to

        “Azariah the priest with eighty other outraged priests of the Lord

        Uzziah, to burn incense to the Lord. That is for the priests, the
        descendants of Aaron, who have been consecrated to burn incense. Leave
        the sanctuary, for you have been unfaithful; and you will not be
        honoured by the Lord God” ((2 Chronicles 26:17-18).

          Pride led him to express unhealthy anger:{' '}
        </Text>
        Uzziah, who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense, became
        angry. While he was raging at the priests in their presence before the
        incense altar in the Lord’s temple, leprosy broke out on his forehead (2
        Chronicles 26: 19).
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Pride led him to become a leper:
        </Text>
        “When Azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him,
        they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead, so they hurried him out.
        Indeed, he himself was eager to leave, because the Lord had afflicted
        him. King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a
        separate house – leprous, and excluded from the temple of the Lord.
        Jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the place of the
        land” (2 Chronicles 26:19-21).
        <br></br>
        Pride is a dangerous fox that Satan uses all the time. I hope you now
        fully understand that “pride actually goes before destruction”. Uzziah
        who was once powerful became powerless because of pride. What a terrible
        experience! This also brings to mind King Herod who died a terrible
        death because of pride (Matt. 2:19). If you want to retain the strength
        that the Lord has given you, which I pray you do, please do away with
        pride and pray that the Lord should give you the spirit of humility. It
        shall be well with you, in the name of Jesus Christ. One of my daily
        prayer points is that the Lord should inculcate in me the spirit of
        humility. He has been faithfully doing so. He will do it in your life,
        too. Yoruba Baptist Hymn says, “fun mi niwa pele, okan tutu, ifarabale
        bi t’oluwa mi, irele ohun suuru ati opo iyonu, ninu ohun gbogbo ki njo
        Jesu”.

          ISAIAH VERSUS UZZIAH
        </Text>
        As I was meditating on King Uzziah and what the Bible says, “in the year
        King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne;
        and the train of his robe filled the temple… woe to me!’ I cried. ‘I am
        ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of
        unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the Lord Almighty” (Isaiah
        6: 1-13). Prophet Isaiah prophesied during the reign of King Uzziah but
        something caught my attention. One, Isaiah was spiritually blind. Two,
        Isaiah was impure, and three, Isaiah operated under a closed heavens.
        Prophet Isaiah became blind and impure probably because King Uzziah
        dazed his life with wealth and that affected his ministerial assignment.
        The life style and the leadership methods of a leader truly determine,
        to a large extent, how far his followers will go and grow in life and
        ministry. Their talents, gifts, potentials, could be made redundant and
        their lives shipwrecked. I have learnt that I have create a plausible
        atmosphere that will facilitate accelerated growth, progressively
        connecting my followers to God, and that I should not be a leader who
        would set bad example for my followers. Do you know that what happened
        during the reign of Uzziah that made Isaiah to spiritually bankrupt is
        still happening today. Some people, Christians are under leaders whose
        lives are not accepted by God; and they are leading their followers to
        hell. I think it will be better for them if their leaders would have to
        die so that they can see the true God. The deaths of a few of church
        leaders in “Kokonbilo” Village orchestrated the deliverances of their
        followers from spiritual darkness when certain secretes about the evil
        deeds of their late leaders began to unfold.

          Likely Leadership Pitfalls
        </Text>
        • Pride: Many leaders allow their ‘Ps’ to ride on them. Pride means
        personality rides on you. Proverbs 16: 18. 2 Chronicles 26: 16-21
        <br></br>• Stopping Warming the “big pot of soup”: Failing to keep
        charging your brain. Leaders should study to show themselves approved (2
        Timothy 2: 14-15). Willing to know and to learn more. A growing leader
        grows growing followers and turn them to disciples.
        <br></br>• Not “Walking the Walk”: this means not being a good model.
        Jesus did walk the walk.
        <br></br>• Doing it All Attitude: Not delegating or assigning people to
        carry out certain responsibility/task on one’s behalf or on behalf of
        the organization. Jesus sent the disciples to buy food in the town (John
        4: 27-31). Delegation demands a lot of endeavor and it may be difficult
        for some leaders to delegate due to lack of trust in their team members.
        A leader who does not delegate would not have time for the
        “broader-view” he or she is responsible for. When a leader assigns
        people to carry out a task, he is developing them, lifting off his neck
        unnecessary burden. This is what Jethro counseled Moses to do (Exodus
        18: 9-27).
        <br></br>• Lack of feedback:
        <br></br>• No or Lack of Clear Goal:
        <br></br>• Misinterpreting Motivation:
        <br></br>• Misunderstanding of Responsibility:
        <br></br>• Domestic Neglect:
        <br></br>• Over-Sensitivity:
        <b></b>• Sexual Sin:
        <br></br>• Lack of Self Control:
        <br></br>• Not able to keep Personal Problem:
        <br></br>• Brushing Aside the Holy Spirit:

          Avoiding of Leadership Pitfalls
        </Text>
        Avoiding leadership pitfalls is a continuous efforts. • Keep God at the
        center of your leadership tasks
        <br></br>• Learn to humble Yourself
        <br></br>• Be ready to Apologise
        <br></br>• Obey God’s Instructions
        <br></br>• Keep learning, etc

          Conclusion
        </Text>
        People, position, pride, power and possession are five “ps” that make or
        mar the life of a person, whether as a leader or subordinate, church
        pastor or church members. When the five “ps” are properly managed, they
        are good weapons for greater achievements. William Feather said, “One
        way to get the most out of life is to look upon it as an adventure-
        Poor, Full, and Idiot. This life, which had been the tomb of his virtue
        and of his honour, is but a walking shadow. No one is permanent in a
        position. Only what is permanent is what one is able to contribute to
        the growth of the organization, and that is speaks after the person has
        left the position. You are in that position to “fill what is empty and
        empty what is full and scratch where it itches”. “When a leader does not
        address the problem. The problem becomes the leader and the leader
        becomes the problem”
