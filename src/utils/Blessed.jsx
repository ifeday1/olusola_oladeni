          Introduction
        </Text>
        Marriage was created by God for the purpose of solving problem:
        psychological loneliness, emotional loneliness, mental loneliness,
        social loneliness, economic loneliness and spiritual loneliness. In
        God’s evaluation and remark, marriage was seeing to be good because it
        was established to make what was not good to be good. If marriage
        institution that was made by God in order to solve human problem is now
        a source of problem among some couples across the globe, stakeholders
        such as churches, governmental and non-governmental, social welfare,
        mediation Centre, etc., should not fold their arms. Why? Marriage
        institution remains the strongest tool in God’s hands to uproot the root
        of evil deeds. Hence, the purpose of this teaching is to re-establish
        and re-assure couples of God’s original intention for couples. In this
        paper therefore, we will examine the following: God’s formation, Satan’s
        Deformation and God’s transformation; Retaining God’s Blessings in the
        Home, the Nature of a Blessed Home and conclusion. The scripture says:
        So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him,
        male and female he created them. God blessed them and said to them, “Be
        fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over
        the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living
        creature that moves on the ground… and they will be yours for food
        (Genesis 1:27-29).

          Formation, Deformation and Transformation
        </Text>
        No home is blessed without a man and a woman who have been blessed
        prophetically by God and still remain sources of blessings to their
        home. God created family/marriage for the purpose of blessing the
        marriage He created. The initial blessing of God upon Adam was not
        complete and that was why God made a woman out of him and for him. What
        was not good was made good. What a wonderful blessings indeed! Genesis
        chapter two tells us how God formed the man. The man was formed from the
        dust of the ground (Genesis 2:7). The book of Genesis 2:15-25) informs
        us how and why God made the woman, Eve for Adam. Originally, God did not
        create marriage for curses but for blessings because God is God who
        blesses. Why the curses? Curses came as a result of satanic deceptive
        agenda in the Garden of Eden, which made Adam and Eve to disobey God
        (Genesis 3). However, God made a better provision for mankind. He sent
        Jesus Christ to die for our sin; a way of restoring us back to the
        original status, opening the very doors of blessing to us. Jesus
        re-established this by His presence at the wedding in Canaan of Galilee
        (John 2:1-11). Like I said our focuses is to call the attention of
        couples to what they should do in order to retain the blessings of God
        in their homes.

          Sustaining God’s Blessings in Your Home
        </Text>
        It is very important to call the attentions of the contemporary couples
        to what they have to do in retaining God’s blessings in their homes
        thus: - Understand God’s vision, action and instruction.
        <br></br> - True contentment
        <br></br> - Agreement
        <br></br> - Conflict Resolution
        <br></br> -Sexual Enjoyment In addition to the above, you need “HOME’ in
        order to have a blessed home. In the context of this paper, HOME is used
        as an acronym thus:
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          H - Honesty:
        </Text>
        This refers to the quality of being honest. To be honest is to be
        telling the truth and never stealing or cheating on one’s partner.
        Honesty is gradually fading away among couples, even Christian couples.
        God condemns all forms of dishonesty. Are you still honesty with the
        spouse or your youth? Have you not broken faith with the wife or your
        youth? God is no more paying attention to your offerings nor accept them
        because you have broken faith with the wife of your youth, the wife of
        your marriage covenant (Malachi 2:13-14). “The story of a group of women
        who went to God for permission to divide the pain of child birth and
        pregnancy.”
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          O - Obedience:
        </Text>
        This refers to an act of obeying or follow an instruction giving by God
        or somebody. The disobedience of Adam and Eve brought curses and
        attached punishment to the word.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          M - Meekness:
        </Text>
        This describes the act of being quiet, gentle and always ready to do
        what other people (members of one’s home) want without expressing your
        own opinion. A meek spouse does not compete but complement his or her
        partner. Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth (Mathew
        5:1-12). When two meek persons come together in marriage, they will
        possess greater wealth.

          E - Endurance:
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          B - Benevolent home{' '}
        </Text>
        Here, the word “blessed” is used as an acronym in order to bring out the
        message therein. It takes a blessed spouse to have a blessed home. : A
        benevolent home is the kind, helpful and generous home
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          L - Liberated home:
        </Text>
        A home that is free from the restrictions of traditional ideas about
        social and sexual behavior
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          E - Edifying home
        </Text>
        : A home where the minds and character of the couple and their children
        are being improved and sanctified. A Christian home should be character
        formation center.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          S - Serving home:
        </Text>
        A home where the couples are willfully serving the Lord. They see
        themselves as God’s servants and are living as such; equally leading
        their children in the same direction.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          S - Sacrificing home:
        </Text>
        a home where couples are willing to give up something important or
        valuable to them in order to get or do something that seems more
        valuable. Examples or such sacrificial giving are: Abraham sacrificed
        Isaac (Gen22:1-19), Hannah gave Samuel to God (1Samuel 1:21-28). I
        strongly believe that “the true test of love is genuine giving to God
        and humanity”.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          E - Encouraging home:
        </Text>
        Is a home where lovers support, hope and courage each other, including
        their children. Manoal’s wife encouraged him when fear of death grappled
        him (Judges 13:21-25). Envisioning home: a home where partners could
        imagine what situation will be like in the future, especially a
        situation they intend to work towards saving for the raining day to
        secure a better financial breakthrough for and in the future.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          D - Devoted home:
        </Text>
        a home where husband and wife, together with their children have great
        love for the sovereign God – the lam that lam, they have decided to be
        loyal to God in studying His word, praying to Him by His word and
        evangelizing by His Power.
        <Text fontWeight='bold' fontSize='15px'>
          Conclusion
        </Text>
        It is only a benevolent, liberated, edifying, serving, sacrificing,
        encouraging and devoted home that will have and retain a blessed home.
        Let’s sing a song of confession thus: “I have a blessed home 2x”. Jesus
        gives me blessed home; I have a blessed home”. “I have a blessed spouse”
        2x, Jesus gives me a blessed spouse; “I have a blessed spouse”. The
        nature of this teaching calls for practical steps. It is necessary to
        bless God with our substance. This is one of the marks of a blessed
        home. One thing, this will surely attract greater blessings to your
        home. Remember the saying that “by thought what you desire is believed
        but by action you receive them”. A song says, Bless my home o Lord!
        Bless my home o Lord! Bless my home o Lord! May your home remain a
        blessed home forever.
