          THE PRESENCE THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN A CHRISTIAN MARRIAGE (JOHN
          02:1 -11)
        </Text>

          Introduction
        </Text>
        In all relationships, especially in marital relationships, the presence
        of God is very important. The lack of God’s presence is tantamount to a
        lack of what it takes to make a Christian home. There was a wealthy man
        in a small village called “Konkobilo”. When he was alive he had
        companies all over the village and surrounding hamlets. All his
        companies were thriving, flourishing, and blossoming because the man was
        around to oversee all business transactions. The demise of the man has
        affected the blossoms of the companies. Today, virtually all the
        companies have folded up – A Yoruba proverb says “This thing is my own
        is different from this thing is our own”. If a company could be brought
        to nothing because the owner is no more, it could be calamitous for an
        institution as marriage that lacks the presence of the owner. This makes
        it imperative for us to consider “The presence that makes the difference
        in a Christian marriage”. The book of John 2:1 -11 sheds better light on
        the efficacy of the presence of the Lord, Jesus Christ in a Christian
        marriage. I would say that the event in John 2:1-11 goes beyond that
        wedding story. It has a great message for singles and couples. For the
        presence of the Lord to become manifest; certain responsibilities, as
        identified in John 2: 1-11 are crucial. The five things potential
        couples and couples should learn from the passage are:
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          Procure a healthy relationship with the Lord (John 2:1 -2):
        </Text>
        A healthy relationship describes a good connection with God. An
        individual couple needs to keep a good connection with the Lord by
        considering the following: Accept Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour,
        receive instructions from the Lord daily; engage in His business, and
        pray according to His will ceaselessly. You attended that wedding you
        attended the last time because there is a relationship that binds you
        with the bridegroom and their parents together. As a branch cannot
        survive without the vine, we should all realize that separating
        ourselves from God is dangerous for our marriages (John 15:5 -7).
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          Prompt invitation to the Lord (John 2:2):{" "}
        </Text>
        There could be another wedding in the town that day but Jesus did not go
        there, maybe because He was not invited or their invitations got to Him
        late. So He had to attend the first invitation received. Invite the Lord
        into your marriage by living a blameless, righteous, holy life. Joseph,
        the earthly father of Jesus and Mary are good example of such life. No
        wonder they enjoyed the presence of the Lord in their relationship. When
        the Lord is involved in all issues of your marriage; no matter how hard
        the issues, it could be resolved gloriously. Let it be known to you that
        a life of living sacrifices for and to the Lord (Rom. 12:1 -2); Praying
        to the Lord ceaselessly, praising the Lord persistently, (1Thess. 5:19)
        etc. are powerful ways of inviting God’s presence into your marriage.
        Remember! The very first condition for inviting the Lord is a healthy
        relationship with the Lord.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          Present your family challenges to the Lord. (John 2:3):
        </Text>
        Present your family challenges to the Lord. (John 2:3): The discussions
        that went on between Jesus Christ and His mother show the kind that
        occurs at such a level of relationship (John 2:4). The finished wine may
        depict marital challenges or problems. “Wine” is a symbol of happiness.
        When marital challenges arise; happiness may subside. At such a moment,
        the Holy Spirit will guide you just as the mother of Jesus intervened.
        Marital challenges may be financial, delay in childbearing, in-laws
        interference/third party palaver, the strange attitude of one or the
        two, which is husband and wife, among others. Since Jesus Christ is
        present in your home, all you have to do is to present your challenges
        to Him. He has the power to challenge and change the situation.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="bold">
          Promote His definite instruction (John 2:5 -8):{" "}
        </Text>
        Presentation of your challenges to the Lord demands that you wait and
        receive definite instruction from Him. The instruction may be “fill the
        six jars” (John 2:7); fast and pray, go to your pastor; repent from
        sinful life, give out your car, serve me, among others. In my own
        opinion, the six jars are things that should be present in a couple's
        life and home, which will precipitate getting solutions to family
        challenges. The six jars that should be present are: First, the jar of
        God’s word. Second, the jar of faith. Third, the jar of obedience.
        Fourth, the jar of prayer. Fifth, the jar of mercy and Sixth, the jar of
        hope. The problem with many couples today is that they present their
        challenges to the Lord but they don’t wait to receive specific
        instructions from the Lord. Manoah and his wife received specific
        instruction from the Lord in their challenges and they finally rejoiced
        over the challenge. Whenever a challenge is presented to the Lord, He
        solves the problem at times by leading the victim to discover a solution
        to the challenge. It is therefore imperative for all couples to be
        willing to receive instruction from God and follow the instruction
        received.

          Portrait the joy of marriage (John 2:9 -10):{" "}
        </Text>
        The scripture says “and the master of the banquet tasted the water that
        had been turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from,
        though the servants who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the
        bridegroom aside and said, everyone brings out the choice wine first and
        then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink; but
        you have saved the best till now (John 2:9 -10). From the statement of
        the masters of the ceremony, three types of couples are identified thus:
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          Choice plus Choice Wine Couple:{" "}
        </Text>
        This explains couples who behave positively to each other regardless of
        their challenges. They have it in my mind that there must be peace and
        joy in their homes. They handle their conflicts and disagreements
        amicably. When one is not happy among the two, the other person will
        make sure that he/she is happy.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          Cheap plus Cheap Wine Couple:{" "}
        </Text>
        Cheap plus Choice Wine Couples: This explains couples who are opposite
        to each other in their characters and attitudes. One of them has a good
        attitude but the other person is very negative. The joy cannot be full
        at all.
        <Text fontStyle="italic" fontWeight="semi-bold">
          Cheap plus Cheap Wine Couple:{" "}
        </Text>
        This describes couples both have – negative attitudes toward each other.
        They don’t care whether their partners are happy is not. They behave to
        each other anyhow, without minding the results. Marriage brings joy and
        happiness to the parents, friends, and well-wishers and more importantly
        to the bridegroom. It is expected that the joy should last but it is not
        so in some marriages. In my opinion, the bridegroom should present the
        best wine- the best attitude, the best character, the best personality,
        the best companion, and the best sex, among others which will lead to
        sustainable joy. If Jesus has not transformed your water”, it cannot
        bring the expected lasting joy in your marriage. Just as the master of
        the ceremony did not know the source of that best wine, people may not
        know the source of your marital joy. Jesus Christ is the source of
        lasting marital joy. You are admonished to allow Him in your life. My
        usual saying is that if Jesus Christ, the prince of peace, is reigning
        in your heart, peace will reign in your home. So when people ask you
        about the source of your marital joy; tell them that Jesus is the
        source.

          Conclusion{" "}
        </Text>
        The presence that makes the difference in a Christian marriage is not
        the presence of a child or children, not the presence of any third
        party, not the presence of money or material things but the presence of
        Jesus Christ, the Lord and the creator of the marriage institution. A
        song says that a home where Jesus lives is a home of joy, which I
        rephrased as a heart where Jesus lives is a heart that has a joyful
        home. Nonetheless, the emphasis is on the efficacy of the presence of
        Jesus in your life and home. Hold him in a tight hostage and you will
        forever be grateful for the difference you will experience in your
        marriage.
