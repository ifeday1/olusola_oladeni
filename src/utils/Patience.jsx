          PATIENCE: A VIRTUE FOR SUSTAINING CHRISTIAN COURTSHIP
        </Text>
        <Text fontWeight="bold" fontSize="15px">
          Introduction
        </Text>
        Some courtships had broken up as a result of a lack of patience in one
        or the two who were in the courtship. Some potential couples have missed
        God’s will for their lives due to a lack of patience. Some are
        regretting today because impatience has robbed them of the true fortune
        their ex-partner now possesses. I strongly believe that knowledge of
        this message will surely help singles in their courtship and future
        marriages. We are considering the topic “Patience: A Virtue for
        Sustaining Courtship Relationship”.

          Courtship Relationship
        </Text>
        Courtship describes the time when two people have a romantic
        relationship before they get married. Courtship is the process of
        developing a marital relationship (Oxford Advanced Learner’s
        Dictionary). The use of the word “romantic” reveals what goes on between
        two unbelievers, and perhaps two believers in Christ who yield to
        temptation in courtship. Courtship explains the period a man and woman
        who have agreed to marry each other spend together before the wedding.
        It may be a period of three or six months or more. A period of one year
        or more. It should be a period for spiritual growth, emotional, social
        physical and financial development. However, some use their courtship
        period wrongly for some nasty things. Courtship is a period of praying
        together, planning together, knowing and building up one another. And
        when people, neighbours, friends or church members see them together,
        they know that they are in a relationship. That is a courtship
        relationship.

          Types of Relationship
        </Text>
        • Friendship relationship <br></br>• Boyfriend/girl-friend relationship{" "}
        <br></br>
        •Course mate relationship <br></br>• Co-worker relationship <br></br>•
        Courtship relationship <br></br>• Marital relationship <br></br>
        There could be other types of relationships but based on the focus of
        this paper, we focus on courtship relationships. All forms of
        relationship demand that those who are in the relationship possess an
        attitude of patience, especially those who are in courtship. This is
        because it will help them better in their marital relationship, which is
        their goal of entering into the courtship in the first instance.

          Patience: A Virtue to be possessed
        </Text>
        According to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary, patience is the
        ability to stay calm and accept a delay or something annoying without
        complaining. It is the ability to spend a lot of time doing something
        difficult that needs a lot of attention and effort. Generally, everybody
        needs patience in life. Anyone who lacks patience can quickly be
        frustrated, can quickly be discouraged, can quickly be disappointed, can
        quickly accept failure, can quickly make a wrong decision, etc. Patience
        is gain. The common saying in Yoruba “Surulere” is literarily
        interpreted to mean no gain in impatience. Patience can cook to be done.
        “Suuru lee se outa Jina”. So everyone needs patience that cooks stone
        until it is done. The scripture says “But the fruit of the spirit is
        love, joy, peace, patience, kindness goodness, faithfulness, gentleness,
        and self-control… (Galatians 5:22 – 23). “Be joyful in hope, patience in
        affliction, faithful in prayer (Romans 12:12). Patience is a virtue
        every Christian, whether singles or married should possess and exhibit.
        It is one of the fruits of the spirit “…patience is better than pride”
        (Ecclesiastes 7:8). Sources of Patience Patience can be traced to the
        following sources <br></br>• Wisdom: “A man’s wisdom gives him patience;
        it is to his glory to overlook an offence (Proverbs 19:11). A patient
        person overlooks offences. This is an area where the ability of a
        patient person lies. A man or a woman who has wisdom does not lack
        patience.
        <br></br>
        •The Spirit: “But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience,
        kindness, goodness, gentleness, faithfulness and self-control (Galatians
        5:22 - 23). Sequel to being born again is the infilling of the Holy
        Spirit. A child of God means a believer in Christ, who is filled with
        the Holy Spirit should automatically manifest the fruit of the spirit.
        This implies that such a person should spiritually be patient with
        people, especially with whoever they are in courtship or marital
        relationship with. <br></br>• Hereditary: Patience could be inherited
        from parents. Some people are naturally patient though they are not born
        again. Perhaps they inherited it from their parents. <br></br>•
        Experience: Impatience may teach one to be patient. The impatience of
        the Tortoise made it have a bar head. He poured hot porridge into its
        cap and covered its head with it. Hence, it's bar head.

          Benefits ofPatience in Courtship
        </Text>
        These benefits also explain the reasons for patience in a relationship.
        At times people may take one’s patience for stupidity. A proverb says
        “Yiyo ekun ti ojo ko”. However, it is generally believed that “Suuru
        lere”, patience has been gained. Let’s examine some benefits of
        patience. <br></br>• Understanding: “A patient man has great
        understanding, but a quick-tempered man displays folly”. A patient
        person takes time to study and understand situations before acting.
        Hence, he behaves wisely. <br></br>• A patient person calms quarrels: “A
        hot-tempered man stirs up dissension, but a patient man calms quarrels
        (Proverbs 15:18). The ability to calm quarrels brings peace and a strong
        relationship whether courtship or marital. <br></br>• A patient person
        achieves better things: “Better a patient man (person) than a warrior, a
        man who controls his temper than one who takes a city” (Proverbs 16:32).
        “Wisdom is better than weapons of war” (Ecclesiastes 9:18). Wisdom gives
        patience”. Although one who practices patience and self-control receives
        far less attention and acclaim than a warrior who takes a city, a
        patient man accomplishes better things”. This is very true. Patience is
        a must-have for everybody, especially those who are Christians and are
        in a relationship. Better things such as (1) a peaceful, strong and
        sustainable relationship, (2) winning against hot-temperedness, (3)
        acquisition of wealth, etc. A person who possesses patience possesses
        everything. <br></br>• A patient person (man) has good self-control. It
        takes a man who possesses good self-control to calm quarrels (Proverbs
        15:18). “A fool shows his annoyance at once a prudent man overlooks an
        insult” (Proverbs 12:16). Other benefits are: • A patient person makes a
        hard situation or things soft and easy to handle. <br></br>• A patient
        person keeps a peaceful and sustainable relationship. <br></br>• A
        patient person is protected from trouble and problems that may ensue
        through impatience. “Patience is bitter but its fruits are sweet”. Yes!
        It is not easy to be patient but a patient person enjoys the above
        benefits and many more.

          Conclusion
        </Text>
        Deducing on the above, it is clear that the place of patience in
        sustaining a relationship cannot be over-emphasized. The reasons for, or
        benefits of patience as highlighted above unveil that to sustain a
        relationship whether courtship or marital, potential couples and married
        couples must possess Christian virtues. Patience is one of such virtues.
        Patience cannot be too much; only that it cannot be enough. A patient
        person could be taken for a fool but wisdom lies with him or her. When
        your patience is tested; give the right answer – be patient. If you
        pass, you’ll enjoy the sweet fruits of patience.
